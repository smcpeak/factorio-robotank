TODO list for RoboTank mod


Allow robots to pick up RoboTanks

Change the recipe to not use a vanilla tank as input

Maybe allow formation rearrangement?

Put a sticker on the vehicle when it is low on fuel or ammo

Change the firing offset back to the default since not using smart
shells is pointless

Provide a way to show the damage stats for each tank?

Boost the turret traverse speed




Older ideas:

- Questionable behavior when multiple transmitters present
- Organize robotanks into squads
  - Limit the number of tanks in a squad
  - Research to increase the squad size limit
- Range limit on the transmitter?
- Detect and avoid running into the shore
- Press key to arrange squad in a line?
- Sticker on robotanks not in a squad?
  - or low on ammo, or fuel, or stuck?
- Open gate when a robotank approaches
- Use LuaBootstrap::on_nth_tick instead of on_tick and tick%n test

Evidently infeasible:

- I want to be able to see fuel and ammo by hovering mouse on a robotank.
