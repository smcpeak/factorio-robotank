TODO list for RoboTank mod


Allow robots to pick up RoboTanks

  Seems to not be posslbe:
  https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=118929

Use the pathfinding API when a tank is stuck

Maybe allow formation rearrangement?

Put an icon on the vehicle when it is low on fuel or ammo

Change the firing offset back to the default since not using smart
shells is pointless

Provide a way to show the damage stats for each tank?

Boost the turret traverse speed




Older ideas:

- Questionable behavior when multiple transmitters present
- Organize robotanks into squads
  - Limit the number of tanks in a squad
  - Research to increase the squad size limit
- Range limit on the transmitter?
- Detect and avoid running into the shore
- Press key to arrange squad in a line?
- Sticker on robotanks not in a squad?
  - or low on ammo, or fuel, or stuck?
- Open gate when a robotank approaches
- Use LuaBootstrap::on_nth_tick instead of on_tick and tick%n test

Evidently infeasible:

- I want to be able to see fuel and ammo by hovering mouse on a robotank.
