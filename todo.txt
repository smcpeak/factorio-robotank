TODO list for RoboTank mod

- Questionable behavior when multiple transmitters present
- RoboTank research should also require advanced-electronics-2 since that is needed for blue circuit.
- Organize robotanks into squads
  - Limit the number of tanks in a squad
  - Research to increase the squad size limit
- Tanks tend to do a lot of unnecessary turning when commander stops.
- Range limit on the transmitter?
- Detect and avoid running into the shore
- Press key to arrange squad in a line?
- Sticker on robotanks not in a squad?
  - or low on ammo, or fuel, or stuck?
- Open gate when a robotank approaches

Evidently infeasible:

- I want to be able to see fuel and ammo by hovering mouse on a robotank.
