TODO list for RoboTank mod

- Sometimes the reversing behavior kicks in while the tank is turning successfully.
- Fix exploit of double-shooting robotank when manually driven by disabling turret temporarily.
- Questionable behavior when multiple transmitters present
- Optimize collision detection to only run every other frame?
- Organize robotanks into squads
- Limit the number of tanks in a squad
- Research to increase the squad size limit
- Put robotanks into idle mode for better performance when not active
- Range limit on the transmitter
- Detect and avoid running into the shore
- Press key to arrange squad in a line?
- Experiment on larger maps
- Sticker on robotanks not in a squad?
  - or low on ammo, or fuel, or stuck?
- Open gate when a robotank approaches

Evidently infeasible:

- I want to be able to see fuel and ammo by hovering mouse on a robotank.
