- Optimize collision detection to only run every other frame?
- Organize robotanks into squads
- Limit the number of tanks in a squad
  - Means saving some data persistently
- Research robotanks and increases to the squad size limit
- Put robotanks into idle mode for better performance when not active
- Sensible recipes for the tanks and transmitter
- Range limit on the transmitter
- Detect and avoid running into the shore
- Press key to arrange squad in a line?
- Experiment on larger maps
- Sticker on robotanks not in a squad?
- Open gate when a robotank approaches
