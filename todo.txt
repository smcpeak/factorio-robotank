TODO list for RoboTank mod

- When tank placed on transport belt, turret gets left behind.
- I want to be able to see fuel and ammo by hovering mouse on a robotank.
- Robotank should avoid running over the player!
- Questionable behavior when multiple transmitters present
- Optimize collision detection to only run every other frame?
- Organize robotanks into squads
- Limit the number of tanks in a squad
  - Means saving some data persistently
- Research to increase the squad size limit
- Put robotanks into idle mode for better performance when not active
- Range limit on the transmitter
- Detect and avoid running into the shore
- Press key to arrange squad in a line?
- Experiment on larger maps
- Sticker on robotanks not in a squad?
- Open gate when a robotank approaches
