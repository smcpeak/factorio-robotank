TODO list for RoboTank mod

- Questionable behavior when multiple transmitters present
- Organize robotanks into squads
  - Limit the number of tanks in a squad
  - Research to increase the squad size limit
- Range limit on the transmitter?
- Detect and avoid running into the shore
- Press key to arrange squad in a line?
- Sticker on robotanks not in a squad?
  - or low on ammo, or fuel, or stuck?
- Open gate when a robotank approaches
- Use LuaBootstrap::on_nth_tick instead of on_tick and tick%n test
- Make the diagnostic verbosity configurable

Evidently infeasible:

- I want to be able to see fuel and ammo by hovering mouse on a robotank.
