robotank-ammo-check-period-ticks=Time between checks for a RoboTank being out of ammo, in ticks.  Raising this improves performance a little, but tanks spend more frames without ammo.
robotank-ammo-move-magazine-count=When a RoboTank turret runs out of ammo, move this many magazines from tank inventory into the turret.  A larger number means the turret runs out, and hence momentarily stops firing, less often.
robotank-diagnostic-verbosity=Adjusts the level of detail logged to factorio-current.log.  0: None, 1: Problems, 2: Squad maintenance events such as being stuck, 3: Changes to internal data structures, 4: Details of algorithms.
robotank-color-red=RoboTanks are colored differently from other tanks to make them visually distinct.  This component must be in [0,1].
robotank-color-green=RoboTanks are colored differently from other tanks to make them visually distinct.  This component must be in [0,1].
robotank-color-blue=RoboTanks are colored differently from other tanks to make them visually distinct.  This component must be in [0,1].
