# The names of the hidden entities can appear if a player is killed
# by one, as the source of the fatal attack.  So, I just call them
# "RoboTank", since conceptually they are part of it.

[entity-description]
robotank-entity=Tank that automatically drives and shoots.  It maintains position relative to a vehicle that has the RoboTank Transmitter in its inventory.
robotank-turret-entity=This is the hidden turret entity responsible for firing bullets and drawing aggro.
robotank-cannon-turret-entity=This is the hidden turret entity responsible for firing cannon shells and drawing aggro.

robotank-transmitter-item=RoboTank transmitter

# Item description appears in the box that pops up when hovering the mouse over the recipe,
# or on the item in the player's inventory.
[item-description]
robotank-transmitter-item=Put this transmitter into a vehicle's inventory to control RoboTanks.
robotank-item=Tank that automatically drives and shoots.  It maintains position relative to a vehicle that has the RoboTank Transmitter in its inventory.

[mod-setting-description]
robotank-ammo-check-period-ticks=Time between checks for a RoboTank being out of ammo, in ticks.  Raising this improves performance a little, but tanks spend more frames without ammo.
robotank-ammo-move-magazine-count=When a RoboTank turret runs out of ammo, move this many magazines from tank inventory into the turret.  A larger number means the turret runs out, and hence momentarily stops firing, less often.
robotank-diagnostic-verbosity=Adjusts the level of detail logged to factorio-current.log.  0: None, 1: Problems, 2: Squad maintenance events such as being stuck, 3: Changes to internal data structures, 4: Details of algorithms.
robotank-color-red=RoboTanks are colored differently from other tanks to make them visually distinct.  This component must be in [0,1].
robotank-color-green=RoboTanks are colored differently from other tanks to make them visually distinct.  This component must be in [0,1].
robotank-color-blue=RoboTanks are colored differently from other tanks to make them visually distinct.  This component must be in [0,1].
