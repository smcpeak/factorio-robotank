robotank-ammo-check-period-ticks=Time between checks for a RoboTank being out of ammo, in ticks.  Raising this improves performance a little, but tanks spend more frames without ammo.
robotank-diagnostic-verbosity=Adjusts the level of detail logged to factorio-current.log.  0: None, 1: Problems, 2: Squad maintenance events such as being stuck, 3: Changes to internal data structures, 4: Details of algorithms.
robotank-impose-cannon-minimum-range=If checked, the cannon has a minimum range of 5, which is needed in order to avoid damaging itself when not using the Smart Cannon Shells mod.  However, it also affects the firing graphics, placing the muzzle flash away from the tank.  See mod description section "Firing cannon shells" for more info.
robotank-color=Tint to apply to RoboTanks so they look different from vanilla tanks.
